## Description

KipuBank is a simple and secure smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain as part of a Web3 developer course assessment. This project demonstrates fundamental Solidity concepts, security best practices, and a professional development workflow using Foundry.

The contract allows users to:
- Deposit native ETH into a personal vault.
- Withdraw ETH from their vault up to a fixed transaction limit.
- Operate within a global deposit cap for the entire bank.

This project emphasizes security, readability, and clear documentation following industry standards.
